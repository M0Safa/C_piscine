# 🏊 42 C Piscine

## 📘 Introduction

The **C Piscine** at 42 is an intensive, month-long coding program designed to evaluate candidates and prepare them to become official 42 students.

It focuses on the fundamentals of the C programming language through 13 progressively challenging modules. The program emphasizes deep understanding of low-level programming and algorithmic thinking rather than relying on high-level abstractions.

Throughout this Piscine, I strengthened my knowledge of:

- Memory management
- Pointers and data structures
- Algorithmic problem solving
- Writing clean and efficient C code
- Working without standard high-level libraries

The goal of the Piscine is not only to learn C syntax, but to build strong logical thinking and understand how software works at a low level.

## 📚 Modules

The Piscine consists of 13 modules covering:

- Basic C syntax
- Functions and loops
- Pointers
- Arrays and strings
- Recursion
- Memory allocation
- Structures
- Makefiles
- And more advanced problem-solving exercises

Each module increases in difficulty and requires writing optimized and norm-compliant code.

## 🤝 Group Projects (Rush & BSQ)

In addition to individual exercises, the Piscine includes intensive team projects:

- Rush 00  
- Rush 01  
- Rush 02  
- BSQ (Biggest Square)

Each Rush project is a **2-day team challenge** where students collaborate to build a complete program under time pressure.

These projects develop:

- Teamwork and communication
- Code organization and planning
- Git collaboration
- Working efficiently under deadlines
- Writing modular and maintainable code

The **BSQ project** (Biggest Square) is one of the most challenging group projects, where the objective is to find the largest possible square in a given map while respecting specific constraints.

## 📝 Weekly Exams

Every week, a practical exam is conducted to evaluate progress.

Each exam consists of:

- 10 exercises
- 4-hour time limit
- Increasing difficulty
- Pure C programming challenges

These exams test:

- Logical reasoning
- Speed and accuracy
- Mastery of C fundamentals
- Ability to solve problems under pressure

The weekly evaluations ensure continuous improvement and simulate real-world development challenges.
